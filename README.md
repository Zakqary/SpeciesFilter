Hello, and thank you for using my Digital Species Filter program. This is intended to making keying species easier, as well as helping build new keys in the future.

To use the program, first run the "speciesfilterdigital.exe" program. Your computer may tell you it's a virus because its an unverified .exe file, but I promise it's just data accessing code and some UI. Once you have the program open, click the "load excel file" button and choose your dataset for digital keying.

I have provided a somewhat complete dataset of the various shared characteristics of Hypogastruridae of North America. This group is what I originally intended the program for, but realized by simply adding a button I could allow the program to be used with any properly formatted excel sheet.

If you wish to make/use your own data set, you will just need an excel sheet with the following formatting requirements:
1) the first column must be labeled "species" with a list of the species you are working with
2) all other columns must be labeled
3) if a species has multiple values for a trait, simply put a comma between them. ex: (tenacular setae: 3, 4)
4) the program only filters out individuals who have a differing value for each trait, so don't worry about leaving traits blank

If those requirements are met, you should be good to go! Enjoy!
